    "description": "The Ninety Minute Chair is a comfortable lounge chair, which has been field tested at the NY Makerfaire as well as the pantry of MakerBot's Headquarters.\r\n\r\nComprised of 9 interlocking pieces, the lounge chair is easily constructed and secured with screws, pegs or adhesives. As shown, one chair can be milled from two sheets of 4\u2019x8\u2019 material, while three sheets of material will efficiently yield a pair of lounge chairs.\r\n\r\nA set of keys, which simplify assembly and lock the furniture parts into place, are included in the download files for milling alongside your chair parts. Alternately, the keys can be 3D printed in colorful ABS plastic, from .stl files found at AtFAB's [Thingiverse page][].\r\n\r\n[Thingiverse page]: http://www.thingiverse.com/atfab\r\n\r\n## How to buy\r\n\r\n<div style= \"margin-top: 25px; display: block;\"></div>\r\n\r\n#### [Managing it Yourself?
