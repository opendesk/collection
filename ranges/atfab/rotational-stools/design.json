    "description": "The Rotational Stools are a complementary pair that share common proportions\n(15\" tall x 9.5\" square) and variations on a rotational structure. They\nfunction equally well as low stools or as side tables - individually, in\npairs, or in aggregate.\n\nA pair of Rotational Stools requires one fourth of a 4'x8' sheet of plywood.\nYou can make 8 stools from a single sheet of plywood, or nest parts into unused\nareas of plywood, as you're cutting other projects.\n",
