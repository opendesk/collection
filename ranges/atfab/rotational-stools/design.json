    "description": "The Rotational Stools are a complementary pair that share common proportions (15\" tall x 9.5\" square) and variations on a rotational structure. They function equally well as low stools or as side tables - individually, in pairs, or in aggregate.\r\n\r\nA pair of Rotational Stools requires one fourth of a 4'x8' sheet of plywood. You can make 8 stools from a single sheet of plywood, or nest parts into unused areas of plywood, as you're cutting other projects.\r\n\r\n## How to buy\r\n\r\n<div style= \"margin-top: 25px; display: block;\"></div>\r\n\r\n#### [Managing it Yourself?
