Comprised of 10 interlocking\npieces, its loads and forces are resolved by a rotationally symmetrical\narrangement of tapered leg assemblies.\n\nThis Rotational Table download works well with a pair of\n[Ninety Minute Chairs][]. The cut files include one table that can be cut\nfrom a single sheet of 4'x8' material.\n\n[Ninety Minute Chairs]: /atfab/90-minute-chair",
