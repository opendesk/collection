    "description": "The Edie set was designed by brothers Joni and David Steiner, for their niece, Edie, who was then 18 months old. Launched in the UK through the Design Museum's [Future is Here](http://designmuseum.org/exhibitions/2013/the-future-is-here) exhibition, the pieces are designed to be simple to finish and put-together, with cutting sheets mastered to create \"air-fix\" style snap out pieces -- aimed at folks who enjoy the satisfaction of finishing something by hand.\r\n\r\nIf making yourself or finishing from sawn, we recommend using wood glue, fine sandpaper and Osmo oil in a satin finish. This gives a natural look whilst being quite hardwearing, and it\u2019s relatively easy to get a nice finish with a few coats & a bit of very light sanding between each one.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you could paint a colour, probably best to use a satinwood or equivalent for robustness \u2013 but best to make sure it\u2019s a child-friendly product!",
