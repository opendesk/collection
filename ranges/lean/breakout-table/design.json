    "description": "The Breakout Table is stand-up meeting table designed to be both a hotdesk and social hub.\r\n\r\nInitially designed for the London tech start-up [Yoyo][], the table brought flexibility and dynamism to the company space, offering employees the chance to gather round and break out from their conventional working routine. At 42 inches tall, it can be used standing up -- great for keeping meetings short and to the point -- or as a high table with bar stools.\r\n\r\nSingle process CNC cutting, natural materials and simple wooden construction with no additional fixings result in a warm yet distinct and contemporary design. Storage hooks and an array of cable tray covers bring functionality and adaptability, making the table a valuable asset to any workspace.\r\n\r\n[Yoyo]: http://justyoyo.com\r\n\r\n## How to buy\r\n\r\n<div style= \"margin-top: 25px; display: block;\"></div>\r\n\r\n#### [Managing it Yourself?
