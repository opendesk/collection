    "description": "The Office Olivia is a perfectly sized single-person desk with a stylish profile thanks to its integrated frame and cable tray.\r\n\r\nLonger and wider than the original [Olivia Desk](/lean/olivia-desk), the Office Olivia is a full workstation that's an ideal fit in your study or living space for home working, or as an individual desk in a professional workspace or office environment.\r\n\r\nThe integral storage/cable tray has an access cover and cable management is hidden in the leg - all helping to create a neat and tidy workplace. Whilst having a plain cable tray cover as standard, this element is modular and works with a growing library of components to allow you to customise your desk - from in-tray to desk tidy to smartphone & tablet holder. The Office Olivia also formed the basis for our Smart Desk hackathon and we\u2019re currently prototyping both a wireless phone charger and LED light modules, amongst other things.\r\n\r\n## How to buy\r\n\r\n<div style= \"margin-top: 25px; display: block;\"></div>\r\n\r\n#### [Managing it Yourself?
