    "description": "A small and irregular table, perfectly formed for informal meetings, particularly with coffee. Options to add castors for mobility, paper dispenser for creativity and/or a pendant light for drama.\r\n\r\nLike its big brother [Meeting][], Caf\u00e9 slots together in seconds and can be taken apart and flattened for easy transport. It's ideal for two to three people, although its shape allows up-to four or five to gather round if need be.\r\n\r\nThe suggested minimum space for one Cafe table is around 10 square metres (105 sqft) or 17.5 square metres (190 sqft) for two.\r\n\r\n[Meeting]: /designs/meeting",
