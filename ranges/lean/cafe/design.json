Options to add castors for mobility, paper\ndispenser for creativity and/or a pendant light for drama.\n\nLike its big brother [Meeting][], Caf\u00e9 slots together in seconds and can be\ntaken apart and flattened for easy transport. It's ideal for two to three\npeople, although its shape allows up-to four or five to gather round\nif need be.\n\nThe suggested minimum space for one Cafe table is around 10 square metres\n(105 sqft) or 17.5 square metres (190 sqft) for two.\n\n[Meeting]: /designs/meeting\n",
