    "description": "Olivia is a single-person desk designed for ease of assembly / disassembly.\nCrafted initially as a personal work desk for urban researcher\n[Olivia Tusinski][], the design was fast tracked onto OpenDesk once a\nsingle-person desk became one of the most requested products after launch.\n\nIt's made up of just four separate components (with legs formed of twin\nlaminated ply sheets, a total of 10 milled parts). The desk fits onto\nhalf a sheet of plywood, can be assembled in a matter of seconds and comes\napart for easy flat storage.\n\nIt's an ideal piece to fit into a study or living space for a freelancer\nor home worker, or as a private, standalone desk in a work space or office.\n\n[Olivia Tusinski]: https://twitter.com/OliviaJTusinski",
