    "description": "Olivia is a single-person desk designed for ease of assembly / disassembly. Crafted initially as a personal work desk for urban researcher [Olivia Tusinski][], the design was fast tracked onto Opendesk once a single-person desk became one of the most requested products after launch.\r\n\r\nIt's made up of just four separate components (with legs formed of twin laminated ply sheets, a total of 10 milled parts). The desk fits onto half a sheet of plywood, can be assembled in a matter of seconds and comes apart for easy flat storage.\r\n\r\nIt's an ideal piece to fit into a study or living space for a freelancer or home worker, or as a private, standalone desk in a work space or office.\r\n\r\n[Olivia Tusinski]: https://twitter.com/OliviaJTusinski",
