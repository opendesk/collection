    "description": "The original Opendesk, an open design project commissioned <span class=\"no-wrap\">by Mint Digital</span> as a generous and flexible four person workstation.\r\n\r\nThe sawtooth edge of the Desk top can be rotated to create individual sections, or to allow two or more colleagues to work co-operatively next to each other, on both sides of the table (either side of the central cable tray). Several desks can also be connected in line to emphasise the sawtooth effect.\r\n\r\nThe suggested minimum space for one Desk (4 work spaces) is around 18 square meters (195 square feet). For two connected Desks the suggested minimum space is around 32 square metres (345 sqft). For an ideal fit, increase the numbers by 15%.\r\n\r\n[Mint Digital]: http://mintdigital.com\r\n\r\n## How to buy\r\n\r\n<div style= \"margin-top: 25px; display: block;\"></div>\r\n\r\n#### [Managing it Yourself?
