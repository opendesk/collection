Slotting together in the same way as little cousin [Caf\u00e9][], it can also be taken apart and flattened for easy transport.\r\n\r\nIt's perfect for hosting meetings for up to eight people, or as a workstation for four or possibly five people at a push. The suggested minimum space for one Meeting table is around 15 square metres (165 sqft) or 27 square metres (300 sqft) for two.\r\n\r\n[Caf\u00e9]: /designs/cafe",
