Slotting together in the same way as little\ncousin [Caf\u00e9][], it can also be taken apart and flattened for easy transport.\n\nIt's perfect for hosting meetings for up to eight people, or as a workstation\nfor four or possibly five people at a push. The suggested minimum space for one\nMeeting table is around 15 square metres (165 sqft) or 27 square metres (300 sqft)\nfor two.\n\n[Caf\u00e9]: /designs/cafe\n",
