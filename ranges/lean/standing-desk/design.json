    "description": "An adjustable, pure CNC standing desk matching the aesthetic of the original [Desk](/lean/desk) that can be set to seated, bar and standing heights.\r\n\r\nDeveloped from the original Desk following feedback from the Opendesk community, the Standing Desk was the most requested item to date! Designed as a generous two person workstation, it sits really comfortably alongside it's older sister. Indeed, when placed back-to-back, two standing desks are the same overall dimension as the original.\r\n\r\nSingle process CNC cutting, natural materials and simple wooden construction with no additional fixings result in a warm yet contemporary design. Height adjustment is a two person, one minute job. At seated height, the frame provides two useful shelves. Back to back, or against a wall, it's perfect for a serious home office or larger work space fit out.\r\n\r\n## How to buy\r\n\r\n<div style= \"margin-top: 25px; display: block;\"></div>\r\n\r\n#### [Managing it Yourself?
