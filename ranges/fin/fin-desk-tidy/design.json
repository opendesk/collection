    "description": "Designed for the [Salone Del Mobile](/milano) in Milan by [Scarlett San Martin](/designers/scarlett-san-martin), the Fin Desk Tidy is a paired-back and fun pen and pencil organiser. \r\n\r\nThe Fin Desk Tidy is easily assembled (think jigsaw puzzle) and can be a great learning tool to build with children. Very easy to disassemble as it is to assemble it makes a lovely addition to the office or the home. On top of that you can personalise by laser cutting a logo or text into its design!\r\n\r\n_Note: You can fit 14 desk tidies onto a standard sheet of ply. For economies of scale the price will be vastly reduced if you order in multiples of   7 or fit with other designs such as [Edie](/edie/edie-set), [Martin Light](/zero/martin-light), [Johann Stool](/nouvelle-fabrique/johann-stool)._",
