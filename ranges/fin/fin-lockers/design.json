    "description": "A continuation of the Fin range the Lockers are unexampled in their approach to a traditional need for a team.\r\n\r\nThe strong design creates full flexibility in the workspace. Typically the first and last thing used in the working day, the Lockers are more than just storage. Brands can build team zones or position as a hub for the business, making it a go-to space for everyone. Like the Fin Bookshelf units can be grouped together or act as standalone pieces, expect to see the Fin range expand in the coming months. \r\n\r\nSee the Fin Lockers in action at [Greenpeace's London HQ](https://www.opendesk.cc/workspaces/greenpeace)",
