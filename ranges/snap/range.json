    "description": "Designed by Ryan McKibbin, the Snap range of tables, chairs and benches features shrewd use of plywood's natural flexibility to cleverly create snap-together, interlocking joins for easy tools-free assembly and disassembly.\r\n\r\nRyan's work is rooted in traditional techniques and his interest in exploring the potential of CAD/CAM. He has extensive knowledge of Rhino3D and related software and teaches Furniture Design and Digital Fabrication at the Catholic University\u2019s School of Architecture and Planning in Washington DC.",
