    "description": "The Kerf Chair, designed by [Boris Goldberg](/designers/boris-goldberg), pushes the design boundaries for on-demand CNC machining.\r\n\r\nThe kerfing technique - milling a series of closely-spaced grooves into a sheet to allow it to bend - is employed to achieve an effect usually associated with the steam-bending of plywood. Kerfing helps avoid the complex process of steaming and pressing sheets of wood onto a bending mould and clamping it all together - in fact, the frame of the chair itself is used as a mould, and adds structural integrity to the final piece.\r\n\r\n[Boris Goldberg](/authors/boris-goldberg) also contributes to our blog, and in his first post he provides an introduction to CNC, you can find it [here](/blog/the-world-of-cnc)!\r\n\r\nPlease contact a [maker near you](https://www.opendesk.cc/open/makers) or [Opendesk](/contact) to get pricing",
