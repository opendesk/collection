    "description": "The simple lines and compact proportions make the Unit Table equally suitable in the dining room at home or working lunches in the office.\r\n\r\nThe Unit Table was originally designed for an exhibition that also hosted evening dinners, with five units used to create one large communal table. With this in mind the legs were kept vertical and the overhang minimised allowing them to sit neatly side-by-side. Cut from a single sheet, the legs are attached with standard furniture bolts to allow easy assembly and dismantling.\r\n\r\nThe Unit Table top is available in laminate or plywood.\r\n\r\n## How to buy\r\n\r\n<div style= \"margin-top: 25px; display: block;\"></div>\r\n\r\n#### [Managing it Yourself?
