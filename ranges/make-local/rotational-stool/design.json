    "description": "The Make Local collection brings together Opendesk designs that have been tweaked specially for the New York Maker Faire 2015. Read more about our collaboration with ShopBot and 100k Garages [on the blog](https://www.opendesk.cc/blog/make-local). \r\n\r\nDuring the faire, visitors will be able to view the designs at the Sketchup stand and get them made in Shopbot's area. Each piece has been designed as an 'Air-Fix' kit fitting onto a small board, easy to carry home and make.\r\n\r\nThe Rotational Stools are a complementary pair that share common proportions (15\u201d tall x 9.5\u201d square) and variations on a rotational structure. They function equally well as low stools or as side tables - individually, in pairs, or in aggregate.\r\n\r\n*New York Maker Faire Pricing:* \r\n\r\n**$34.80** \r\n+ sales tax \r\n\r\n**If you can\u2019t make it to the faire this year you can still download the designs [here](https://www.opendesk.cc/open/make-local/rotational-stool/make-it-yourself) for a limited time only!**",
