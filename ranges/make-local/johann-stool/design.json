Read more about our collaboration with ShopBot and 100k Garages [on the blog](https://www.opendesk.cc/blog/make-local). \r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the faire, visitors will be able to view the designs at the Sketchup stand and get them made in Shopbot's area. Each piece has been designed as an 'Air-Fix' kit fitting onto a small board, easy to carry home and make.\r\n\r\nA stool designed by Johann Aussage as part of the Make Local range.\r\nThe original design, the [Johann Stool](/nouvelle-fabrique/johann-stool) could be personalised with uniquely generated surface patterns as a reward for Opendesk crowd equity investors.  This new design features a refined shape.\r\n\r\n*New York Maker Faire Pricing:* \r\n\r\n**$36.60** \r\n+ sales tax\r\n\r\n**If you can\u2019t make it to the faire this year you can still download the designs [here](https://www.opendesk.cc/open/make-local/johann-stool/make-it-yourself) for a limited time only!**",
