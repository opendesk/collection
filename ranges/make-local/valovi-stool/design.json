    "description": "The Make Local collection brings together Opendesk designs that have been tweaked specially for the New York Maker Faire 2015. Read more about our collaboration with ShopBot and 100k Garages [on the blog](https://www.opendesk.cc/blog/make-local). \r\n\r\nDuring the faire, visitors will be able to view the designs at the Sketchup stand and get them made in Shopbot's area. Each piece has been designed as an 'Air-Fix' kit fitting onto a small board, easy to carry home and make.\r\n\r\nThe Valovi stool is a simplified version of the [Valovi](/studio-dlux/valovi-chair) chair, featuring 10 interlocking pieces which can be easily assembled.  The Stool is designed to fit on a small 30\u2019 x 24\u2019 sheet and is available in \u201cairfix\u201d form, for the avid maker. \r\n\r\n*New York Maker Faire Pricing:* \r\n\r\n**$36** \r\n+ sales tax\r\n\r\n**If you can\u2019t make it to the faire this year you can still download the designs [here](https://www.opendesk.cc/open/make-local/valovi-stool/make-it-yourself) for a limited time only!**",
