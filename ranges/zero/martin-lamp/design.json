    "description": "The Martin Lamp is the first of its kind to appear on Opendesk. Designed by [00 Architect](http://www.architecture00.net/) [Lynton Pepper](/designers/lynton-pepper), the lamp is ultra-lightweight and can easily be added to a breakout area to present a calm zonal space.\r\n\r\nBeing very lightweight it\u2019s suited to having its back to a wall or in-between [seating](/categories/seating). Made out of our standard 18mm ply the cable and bulb are left to you to customise. In the images we\u2019ve used a smooth red fabric lighting cable with a traditional Edison squirrel cage 60w bulb. \r\n\r\n_Note: Makers might require a minimum order or fit with other designs such as [Edie](/edie/edie-table), [Desk Tidy](/fin/desk-tidy), [Johann Stool](/nouvelle-fabrique/johann-stool)._",
