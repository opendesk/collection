    "description": "The Martin Lamp is the first of its kind to appear on Opendesk. Designed by [00 Architect](http://www.architecture00.net/) [Lynton Pepper](/designers/lynton-pepper), the lamp is ultra-lightweight and can easily be added to a breakout area to present a calm zonal space.\r\n\r\nBeing very lightweight it\u2019s suited to having its back to a wall or in-between [seating](/categories/seating). Made out of our standard 18mm ply the cable and bulb are left to you to customise. In the images we\u2019ve used a smooth red fabric lighting cable with a traditional Edison squirrel cage 60w bulb. \r\n\r\n_Note: Makers might require a minimum order or fit with other designs such as [Edie](/edie/edie-table), [Desk Tidy](/fin/desk-tidy), [Johann Stool](/nouvelle-fabrique/johann-stool)._\r\n\r\n## How to buy\r\n\r\n<div style= \"margin-top: 25px; display: block;\"></div>\r\n\r\n#### [Managing it Yourself? Get quotes from a local maker \u00bb]()\r\n\r\nTo get a price you can connect to a [maker near you.](https://www.opendesk.cc/open/makers) With this design most makers will need an order of larger than one to avoid material wastage so before you request a quote increase the quantity or see if there are any other designs you can bundle together. On many occasions the unit price can come down with a bulk order! \r\n\r\n#### [Find out more about how it works \u00bb](https://www.opendesk.cc/designs/how-it-works)\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-size: 90%;\">_PLEASE NOTE: Pricing varies based on your location and local maker capacity._\r\n\r\n<div style= \"margin-top: 25px; display: block;\"></div>",
