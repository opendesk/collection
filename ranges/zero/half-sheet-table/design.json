    "description": "A small, lightweight, elegant table (as featured in Wired magazine) for use in the office or at home.\r\n\r\nDesigned to be extremely cost effective, both in terms of material and machine time, the table requires only half a sheet of one-sided CNC cut plywood. Even the offcuts have been designed to produce a small accompanying stool which comes as part of the set.\r\n\r\nThe table literally slots together in seconds and is held together by friction joints -- without any need for laminating components, gluing or screwing -- which means it can be easily disassembled for storage or transport at a later date. (The stool does require some screw fixings).\r\n\r\nThe table comfortably accommodates two to three people. It also accommodates seven or more people really uncomfortably.\r\n\r\n## How to buy\r\n\r\n<div style= \"margin-top: 25px; display: block;\"></div>\r\n\r\n#### [Managing it Yourself?
