    "description": "The layout table has been designed for the working habits and design sensitivity of creative users. The balanced proportions and subtle design details discreetly complement a users workflow.\r\n\r\nUsers can personalise their Layout table by choosing from a range of tool trays which slot seamlessly into the table. Each tray has been designed to cater for the needs of different user groups such as artists, designers, illustrators and writers.\r\n\r\nThe top of the table can be removed and rotated, allowing users both sides for different tasks. A popular use of this feature is to have a clean side for general tasks and a spoil side for making models or artwork.\r\n\r\nIt's available in 3 sizes, small (1400 x 700) medium (1500 x 750) and large (1600 x 750). All size options are extremely cost effective and have been designed to be cut from a single sheet of standard size birch ply.",
